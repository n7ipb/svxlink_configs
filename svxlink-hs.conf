#	Sample PNW220 system SVXLink configuration file
#   *** Hotspot version ***                                 
#
#       N7IPB - 03/18/2021
#
#   Two instances of N0CALL need to be customized
#   AUTH credentials for ReflectorLogic need to be entered
#   RxSimplex and TxSimplex need to be adjusted for your chosen interface
#   If you want EchoLink Apppend ModuleEchoLink to the MODULES line and edit
#   /etc/svxlink/svxlink.d/ModuleEchoLink.conf for your echolink credentials
#   If using this to access a repeater the repeater needs to be configured
#   to drop CTCSS on the transmitter whenever the input signal goes away
#   You do NOT want CTCSS during the repeater hang time
#
#   The suggested values for some fields are specific to pnw220.net
#   If you are in a different part of the world the values of things 
#   like the talk groups will vary
