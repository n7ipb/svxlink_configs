# svxlink_configs

## Sample svxlink configuration files to use as templates.

### Just copy the desired file to your ../etc/svxlink/svxlink.conf file.

- svxlink-hs.conf	A simplex system to be used as either a local Hot Spot connected
			to an svxreflector system and/or an EchoLink transceiver.
			Both use a local transceiver but in the Hot Spot mode it also connects to 
			a reflector and allows users on the radio side to access a reflectors talk
			groups. With EchoLink configured radio users can access the EchoLink system
			but not the reflector (if configured) at the same time.

- svxlink-repeater.conf	A typical pnw220.net repeater configuration
